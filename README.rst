Packages
========

This is just a scratchboard for a possible packaging system.

Chances are that I'll never end up writing anything. Who knows.

Ideas
-----

- User namespaced
- SCM based (tags are releases)


Ummm.. Why?
-----------

I've spent 3 hours today trying to deal with some deep dependency of
someone's broken package. I want this to take seconds.

I want:

- Simple nested requirements overrides
- Simple-as-humanely possible private mirroring
- backwards compatibility w/ pip/easy_install, or something.
