Packages
========

This is just a scratchboard for a possible packaging system.


Ideas
-----

- User namespaced
- SCM based (tags are releases)


Ummm.. Why?
-----------

I want:

- Simple nested requirements overrides
- Simple-as-humanely possible private mirroring
- backwards compatibility w/ pip/easy_install, or something.
